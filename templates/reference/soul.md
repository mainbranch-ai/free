# Soul

*Why you exist. What you believe. The truth beneath the offer.*

---

## Why This Business Exists

<!-- What's the personal story? What happened that made you start this? -->
<!-- This isn't marketing copy -- it's the honest origin. Write it for yourself. -->



---

## Core Beliefs

<!-- What do you believe about the world that makes your business make sense? -->
<!-- Format: "We believe..." statements. 3-5 is enough to start. -->

## Your Parts

<!-- From the Tony Robbins / Alex Hormozi framing: most people have an executor self and a connected self. -->
<!-- The executor gets things done. The connected self stays in touch with why it matters. -->
<!-- Name yours. When does each show up? -->

| Part | Name | When It Shows Up |
|------|------|------------------|
| **Executor** | | |
| **Connected** | | |

## The Offer-Fit Test

*Three questions to determine if you're in the right business:*

1. **What do you research when no one's watching?**

   <!-- Your answer here -->

2. **What intersections excite you when you find them?**

   <!-- Your answer here -->

3. **What decisions feel like discovery vs obligation?**

   <!-- Your answer here -->

<!-- If your offer doesn't connect to these, you're pushing. You'll burn out or dissociate. -->
<!-- If your offer DOES connect, the think cycle becomes self-sustaining. Pull, not push. -->

## Anti-Patterns (What Kills the Soul)

<!-- Things that drain your energy and disconnect you from the work. -->
<!-- Knowing these helps you avoid them. -->
