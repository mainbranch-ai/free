# Decision: Three-Tier Pricing Structure

## Context

Currently offering one tier at $97/month. Growth has plateaued at 150 members. Need to decide whether to add tiers to capture more of the market.

**Trigger:** Three members asked about "advanced" content in the same week.

---

## Research Summary

- Competitors use 2-3 tiers, range $47-197/month
- Free tiers convert 5-15% to paid within 60 days
- Three-tier pricing captures both budget and power users
- Our audience responds to "investment" framing

See: research/2026-01-15-pricing-tier-analysis-gemini.md

---

## Considered Options

### Option A: Keep Single Tier

Stay at $97/month, focus on value.

**Pros:**
- Simple, no confusion
- Premium positioning maintained

**Cons:**
- Missing free-tier lead generation
- Leaving money on table from power users

**Effort:** None

---

### Option B: Two-Tier (Free + Paid)

Add free tier with limited content.

**Pros:**
- Lead generation at scale
- Lower barrier to entry

**Cons:**
- Dilutes community quality
- Support burden from free members

**Effort:** Medium

---

### Option C: Three-Tier (Free + $97 + $297)

Full tier structure with free, standard, and premium.

**Pros:**
- Maximum market capture
- Natural upgrade path
- Premium tier for power users

**Cons:**
- More complex to manage
- Potential confusion
- Must clearly differentiate tiers

**Effort:** High

---

## Decision

**We chose: Option C (Three-Tier)**

The research shows three tiers maximizes both reach and revenue. Our audience values "investment" framing, so premium tier won't cannibalize base tier. The member requests for "advanced" content validate demand for premium.

---

## Consequences

### What Becomes Easier

- Lead generation through free tier
- Upselling committed members to premium
- Revenue growth without member count growth

### What Becomes Harder

- Content planning (must differentiate tiers)
- Community management (three member segments)
- Messaging (explaining tier differences)

### What We're Accepting

- Free tier members may be lower quality
- Premium tier needs exclusive content we haven't created yet
- 30-60 days to see if this works

---
