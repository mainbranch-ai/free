## Status Values

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Research in progress, not yet synthesized |
| `complete` | Synthesis done, ready to inform decisions |
| `codified` | Findings have been applied to reference files |
| `superseded` | Newer research replaces this |

## Linking to Decisions

When a decision uses this research, update the frontmatter:

```yaml
linked_decisions:
  - decisions/2026-01-17-pricing-strategy.md
  - decisions/2026-01-18-guarantee-policy.md
```

This creates a bidirectional link (research links forward to decisions, decisions link back to research).

---

## Quality Checklist

# Pricing Tier Strategy Research

## Question

What pricing tier structure should we use for the community membership?

**Why this matters:** Currently one tier at $97/month. Considering adding free tier or premium tier. Need data to decide.

---

## Sources Checked

| Source | What We Found |
|--------|---------------|
| Competitor analysis (5 communities) | $47-197/month range, most have 2-3 tiers |
| Skool pricing norms | Free tier common for lead gen, paid starts at $47-97 |
| Past member feedback | 3 members mentioned wanting "advanced" content |
| Industry benchmarks (SaaS pricing research) | 3 tiers is optimal, middle tier gets 60% of signups |

---

## Raw Findings

### Competitor Pricing

- Community A: Free / $67/month / $197/month
- Community B: $97/month only (premium positioning)
- Community C: Free / $47/month (high volume)
- Community D: $147/month / $297/month (ultra-premium)
- Community E: Free / $97/month / $497/year

### Member Feedback

[Detailed quotes and feedback...]

### Industry Data

[Pricing psychology research, conversion data...]

---

## Synthesis

### One-Sentence Summary (20 words max)

Three-tier pricing with free/paid/premium maximizes reach while creating natural upgrade paths for committed members.

### Key Findings

1. Two-tier (free/paid) is minimum viable for lead generation
2. Three-tier captures both budget-conscious and power users
3. Middle tier gets 60%+ of signups in most communities
4. Annual pricing increases retention 30-40% vs monthly
5. Premium tier should be 2-3x base price, not 1.5x
6. Free tier converts 5-15% to paid within 60 days
7. "Investment" framing outperforms "deal" framing for our audience

### Implications for Reference Files

| File | Potential Update |
|------|------------------|
| `reference/core/offer.md` | Add tier descriptions, pricing logic |
| `reference/core/audience.md` | Segment by tier (free seeker vs committed buyer) |
| `reference/proof/angles/value.md` | Update ROI math for each tier |

### Open Questions

- What should the free tier include to create desire for paid?
- Should premium be monthly or annual-only?
- How do we position the upgrade without devaluing free?
