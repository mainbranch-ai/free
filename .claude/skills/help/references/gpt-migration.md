# Migrating Your GPT Knowledge Base

You've built up context in ChatGPT. Here's how to bring it to Main Branch - and why /think is the perfect tool for this.

---

## The Short Answer

Yes, you can dump everything into Claude. Paste text, drag files, share whatever you have.

But there's a better approach: treat this as a /think cycle.

---

## Why Use /think for Migration

This isn't just "move data from A to B." It's an opportunity to:
- Research what's actually valuable in your GPT history
- Decide what belongs in your reference files
- Codify the best stuff into organized, evergreen content
- Leave behind the noise

The migration becomes a learning process, not just a copy-paste.

---

## The /think Approach

Run:
```
/think "How to extract and migrate my GPT knowledge base to Main Branch"
```

### Research Phase

Questions to explore:
- What's in my GPT projects? (knowledge files, chat history)
- What formats can I export?
- What's actually valuable vs. just conversation noise?
- How should this map to Main Branch's reference structure?

### Decide Phase

Decide on:
- Which GPT content is worth migrating
- How to organize it (offer.md, audience.md, voice.md, angles/)
- What to summarize vs. import verbatim
- What to leave behind

### Codify Phase

Execute the migration:
- Export/copy the valuable content
- Paste or share with Claude
- Have Claude sort it into the right reference files

## Practical Extraction Methods

### Option 1: Copy-Paste Conversations

1. Open your GPT project
2. Find valuable conversations (strategy, positioning, copy that worked)
3. Copy the text
4. Paste into Claude
5. Tell Claude: "Sort this into my reference files"

### Option 2: Export Knowledge Base Files

If you uploaded documents to GPT:
1. Find those original files on your computer
2. Drag them into Terminal
3. Tell Claude: "Read these and extract what's relevant"

### Option 3: Screenshot and Describe

For complex GPT outputs:
1. Screenshot the key parts
2. Drag into Terminal
3. Tell Claude what it means and where it should go

## What Goes Where

| GPT Content | Main Branch Location |
|-------------|---------------------|
| Offer details, pricing | reference/core/offer.md |
| Audience insights | reference/core/audience.md |
| Voice/tone examples | reference/core/voice.md |
| Testimonials | reference/proof/testimonials.md |
| Winning ad copy | reference/proof/angles/ |
| Strategy discussions | research/ (dated) |
| Decisions made | decisions/ (dated) |

---

## Don't Migrate Everything

GPT conversations have a lot of noise:
- Back-and-forth refinement
- Experiments that didn't work
- Duplicate explanations
- Casual chat

Extract the gems. Leave the fluff.

Your reference files should be:
- Evergreen (still true today)
- Specific (actionable details)
- Organized (easy to find)

---

## The Compound Benefit

Once your GPT knowledge is in Main Branch:
- Your reference files are richer
- You can refine it over time
- It survives forever (not buried in chat history)
- It compounds with new learnings

This migration is an investment. Do it thoughtfully.

## Next Step

Ready to migrate? Run:
```
/think "Migrate my GPT knowledge base to Main Branch"
```

Claude will guide you through the research and decision phases, then help you execute the actual migration.
