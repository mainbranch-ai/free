# Making Outputs Better

Your outputs are only as good as your reference files. Here's how to improve quality over time.

---

## The Formula

**Better reference = Better outputs**

When you use any generation skill or work with Claude, it reads your reference files. If those files are thin, vague, or outdated, your outputs will be too.

The path to better outputs is always the same: improve your reference.

## What "Good Reference" Looks Like

### offer.md
- Specific pricing (not "varies")
- Clear mechanism (how it works)
- Concrete deliverables (what they get)
- Explicit guarantee (if you have one)
- Transformation described (before -> after)

### audience.md
- Specific person (not "anyone who...")
- Real pain points (in their words)
- Actual desires (specific outcomes)
- Known objections (what stops them)
- Where they hang out (platforms, communities)

### voice.md
- Tone descriptors (direct, warm, etc.)
- Actual phrases you use
- Personality markers (humor, formality)
- Words you never use
- Examples of your writing

### testimonials.md
- Specific outcomes (numbers, timeframes)
- Named people (with permission)
- Before/after contrast
- Emotional language preserved
- Context (how long, what tier, etc.)

### angles/
- Documented hooks that worked
- Why they worked (analysis)
- Target awareness level
- Supporting proof

## When Outputs Feel "Off"

If generated content doesn't sound like you or misses the mark:

### Check: Is voice.md detailed enough?

Thin voice = generic outputs. Add:
- 10+ actual phrases you use
- 5+ phrases you'd never use
- Examples from your actual writing

### Check: Is audience.md specific?

"Entrepreneurs" is too broad. Who specifically? What's their day look like? What keeps them up at night?

### Check: Are angles documented?

If you're not getting the hooks you want, document what works. Show Claude winning examples from your past.

## The Improvement Loop

1. **Generate** - Work with Claude, get outputs
2. **Evaluate** - What worked? What didn't?
3. **Diagnose** - Which reference file is the weak link?
4. **Enrich** - Add context to that file
5. **Regenerate** - Try again

This loop is how you tune the system to your voice and market.

## What to Do Next When Stuck

### "I don't know what to add"

Run `/think research "What's missing from my [offer/audience/voice] documentation"`

Claude will help you identify gaps by asking questions.

### "I have content but it's messy"

Run `/think codify` and paste everything you have. Claude will sort it.

### "I need fresh angles"

Run `/think "What messaging angles work for [your market]?"`

Research -> Decide -> Codify.

### "My outputs are generic"

Add more specific examples. Generic reference = generic output. Specificity is the cure.

## The Compound Effect

Week 1: Basic reference files. Outputs are okay.

Week 4: Added testimonials, refined voice. Outputs sound more like you.

Week 12: Documented winning angles, updated audience insights from customer calls. Outputs nail your market.

Month 6: Comprehensive reference from dozens of research cycles. Outputs are consistently on-point.

This is the compound effect in action. Each improvement builds on the last.

## Quick Wins

If you want better outputs today:

1. **Add 3 real testimonials** with specific outcomes
2. **Write 10 phrases** you actually use
3. **Document 1 winning hook** and why it worked
4. **Describe your ideal customer** in painful detail

These additions immediately improve output quality.

## The Long Game

Main Branch rewards investment.

The businesses that get the most value are the ones that:
- Run /think regularly to research and decide
- Feed learnings back into reference
- Treat reference files as living documents
- Keep context current with market changes

Your reference files are your competitive advantage. The more you invest in them, the better everything else gets.

## Next Step

Identify your weakest reference file. Run `/think codify` and focus on improving just that one file. Notice how outputs change.
