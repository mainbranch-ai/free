# Philosophy: Why Main Branch Works

## The Core Insight

**Passive memory keeps you shallow. Active reference is the thinking.**

ChatGPT "remembers" things in a black box. You never see it. Never refine it. Never challenge it.

Here, you articulate your offer, audience, angles. You write them down. You refine them. That act of building reference files IS the learning. You understand your business more deeply than passive memory allows.

---

## Compound Knowledge

Each piece of reference makes the next output better:

```
Research -> Decide -> Codify -> Generate -> Learn -> (repeat)
```

Your knowledge compounds. The more you feed it, the better it performs. Unlike chat that forgets, your repo IS the truth.

For the full workflow, see [the-think-cycle.md](the-think-cycle.md).

## Marketing Reflects the Present

Markets shift. What worked last quarter might not land today.

Reference files stay current with reality. Feed learnings back continuously. Update angles when you find what works. Retire what doesn't.

---

## You Control Everything

No black box. No mystery.

- You see the files Claude reads
- You decide what goes in them
- You refine until they're right

You're not hoping AI "gets" your business. You're teaching it explicitly.

## The Interface is the Commodity

There's a million ways to interact with your data:
- Claude Code (Terminal or IDE)
- Claude on your phone
- ChatGPT with GitHub connected
- Claude cowork for visual exploration

**The interface doesn't matter. Your reference files do.**

They're the truth. Any tool can read them. You're not locked into anything.

## GitHub Sync: Your Data Everywhere

Push your repo to GitHub:
- Team sees the same context
- Access from your phone
- Use across different AI tools
- Never lose your work

The conversation is temporary. The files are permanent.

## One Engine, Many Businesses

Same mb-free powers your main business, client accounts, side projects, even personal life.

Each gets its own repo. Same skills, different data, different outputs.

---

## Conversations Are Disposable

Counterintuitive but critical: **if you're using the system correctly, conversations become disposable.**

The instinct to "save everything" is fear of losing context. That fear is the symptom -- you haven't extracted what matters.

**In a good session, value migrates to files:**
- Insight? -> `research/`
- Decision? -> `decisions/`
- Truth changed? -> `reference/`

The conversation is scaffolding. The building stands without it.

**The test:** Feel the urge to save a conversation? Stop. Ask: "What actually mattered?" Put that in the right file. Let the rest go.

**For tracking work across sessions:** See [task-tracking-options.md](task-tracking-options.md).

## The Endgame

Over time, your reference becomes a comprehensive, accurate representation of your business. Every output draws from this truth.

Outputs sound like you because they're informed by your actual thinking, refined over time.
