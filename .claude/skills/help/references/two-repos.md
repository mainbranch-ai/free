# The Two Repos: Engine + Data

This is the key concept. Once you get this, everything else makes sense.

## mb-free (The Engine)

The shared system everyone uses. Contains:
- Skills (`/think`, `/setup`, `/start`, `/help`, `/pull`)
- Templates and frameworks

**You download updates from this. You never edit it.**

You have read-only access. Think of it like software you install. You use it, you don't rewrite it.

---

## Your Business Repo (Your Data)

YOUR personal folder. Contains everything about YOUR business:
- Your offer, pricing, mechanism
- Your audience, their pains and desires
- Your voice, tone, phrases
- Your testimonials and proof
- Your research and decisions

**You create this when you run `/setup`. You own and control everything in it.**

This is what makes your outputs sound like YOU.

## How They Work Together

```
mb-free/                      your-business/
├── Skills                    ├── Your offer
├── Templates                 ├── Your audience
├── Frameworks                ├── Your voice
└── (shared, read-only)       └── (yours, you own it)
```

The engine (mb-free) reads your business data and helps you build reference files.

**Same engine + different data = different context for each business.**

## The Game Engine Analogy

Unity (the game engine) provides physics, rendering, audio systems. But Unity alone isn't a game. You need assets: characters, levels, sounds.

The engine + your assets = your game.

- **mb-free** = Unity (the engine)
- **Your business repo** = Your game assets
- **Skills** = Engine features you can use
- **Reference files** = The assets that make it yours

## Why Two Repos?

**Separation of concerns:**
- Engine updates don't touch your data
- Your changes don't break the engine
- You can back up your data separately
- Multiple businesses can use the same engine

**Portability:**
- Your data is yours forever
- You can move it anywhere
- Not locked into any platform
