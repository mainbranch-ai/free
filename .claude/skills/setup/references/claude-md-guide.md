# CLAUDE.md Guide

How to draft an effective CLAUDE.md for a business repo.

---

## Purpose

Your entire repo is a precision instrument for LLM context quality. Every file should earn its place. CLAUDE.md is the lightest layer -- summaries and pointers, not full content.

CLAUDE.md is the **always-loaded business brain**. Claude reads this file at the start of every session. It should contain:

- Enough context to work effectively
- Pointers to deeper reference files
- Current state and key decisions

**Not too much** -- keep it scannable. Put deep details in reference files.

---

## Structure

```markdown
# [Business Name]

[One sentence: What this business is]

---

## Engine

This repo contains your **business data**. It's powered by **mb-free** (the engine).

**Setup:**
1. Clone mb-free: `git clone https://github.com/mainbranch-ai/mb-free.git`
2. In Claude Code, add mb-free as an "additional working directory"
3. Work in THIS repo as your primary directory

**How it works:**
- Engine (mb-free): Contains skills and frameworks. You pull updates but never edit.
- Data (this repo): Contains your business context. You own and edit this.
- Skills read from your `reference/` and help build your context

**Available skills:** `/start`, `/think`, `/setup`, `/pull`, `/help`

## Progressive Disclosure

CLAUDE.md is **Tier 1** -- always loaded, so keep it lean.

Pattern:
1. **Summary in CLAUDE.md** -- Quick reference
2. **Pointer to full file** -- "Full system: `reference/core/voice.md`"
3. **Claude loads on-demand** -- When actually needed

Example:
```markdown
## Voice (Quick Reference)

**Tone:** Calm, grounded, never preachy
**Key phrases:** "Wearable notes to self", "Stay awake. Stay happy."

**Full system:** `reference/core/voice.md`
```

---

## Length Guidelines

- **Ideal:** 100-300 lines
- **Maximum:** 500 lines
- **If longer:** Move content to reference files

CLAUDE.md shares context window with everything else. Keep it tight.

---

## Update Cadence

Update CLAUDE.md when:
- Business state changes significantly
- New major decisions are made
- Strategy shifts
- Key metrics update (quarterly)

Don't update for:
- Every small change
- New research (goes in `research/`)
- New testimonials (goes in `proof/`)
