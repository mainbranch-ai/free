## This Repo

This is the **data repo** (knowledge base) for [Business Name].

It uses [mb-free](https://github.com/mainbranch-ai/mb-free) as the **engine** -- skills and frameworks that help you build your reference files.

### Setup

1. **Clone the engine** (if you haven't):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mainbranch-ai/mb-free.git
   ```

2. **In Claude Code**, add mb-free as an additional working directory

3. **Work in this repo** as your primary directory

### How It Works

```
ENGINE (mb-free)   +     DATA (this repo)     =     OUTPUT
├── Skills                      ├── reference/            ├── Better context
└── Pull updates, don't edit    └── You own this          └── Better decisions
```

Skills from the engine read your `reference/` files and help you build better business context.
```
