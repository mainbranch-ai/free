# Git Workflow

GitHub CLI best practices for Main Branch repos.

---

## Always Use Git

Every Main Branch business repo should be version controlled. Git provides:

- History of all changes
- Ability to revert mistakes
- Collaboration with team members
- Backup of your business knowledge

---

## Initial Setup

```bash
# If starting fresh
git init
git add -A
git commit -m "[init] Bootstrap business repo with Main Branch structure"

# Connect to GitHub (optional but recommended)
gh repo create [business-name] --private --source=. --push
```

---

## Commit Message Format

Always use this format:

```
[type] Brief description (50 chars max)

- Detail 1
- Detail 2
- Detail 3

```

### Types

| Type | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `[init]` | Initial repo setup |
| `[add]` | New files, features, content |
| `[update]` | Changes to existing files |
| `[fix]` | Bug fixes, corrections |
| `[refactor]` | Restructuring without changing behavior |
| `[docs]` | Documentation only changes |
| `[remove]` | Deleting files |
| `[research]` | Adding research files |
| `[decision]` | Adding decision files |

### Examples

## Using HEREDOC for Commits

Always use HEREDOC for multi-line commit messages to ensure proper formatting:

```bash
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
[type] Brief description

- Detail 1
- Detail 2

Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5 <noreply@anthropic.com>
EOF
)"
```

**Why HEREDOC?**
- Preserves line breaks
- Handles special characters
- Works reliably across systems

---

## Staging Best Practices

```bash
# Stage everything
git add -A

# Stage specific files
git add reference/core/offer.md reference/core/audience.md

# Stage by folder
git add reference/proof/

# Check what's staged
git status
```

---

## Safety Rules

1. **Never force push to main** -- Protect your history
2. **Commit frequently** -- Small, logical commits
3. **Check status before commit** -- Review what's staged
4. **Use descriptive messages** -- Future you will thank you
5. **Include Co-Authored-By** -- Credit AI assistance

---

## GitHub CLI Reference

```bash
# Check authentication
gh auth status

# Create private repo and push
gh repo create [name] --private --source=. --push

# View repo in browser
gh repo view --web
```

---
