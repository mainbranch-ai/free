# Philosophy

**Main Branch is not a tool. It's a philosophy about how to work with AI -- and yourself.**

---

## The Surface Layer

"AI-native business operating system for creators and coaches. Build the system that runs your business."

But that's marketing copy.

---

## The Real Answer

**Main Branch is a reconnection mechanism.**

The core insight -- from Tony Robbins' interview with Alex Hormozi -- is that most business owners become *dissociated* from their work. They execute brilliantly but feel nothing. They get their thousandth testimonial and think "yeah, of course." The magic is gone.

**Reference files are the solution.** Not documentation. Not "AI memory." They're identity work. The act of writing `soul.md`, updating `offer.md`, refining `voice.md` -- this keeps you *associated* with WHY you do this.

## What Makes It Different

| Others | Main Branch |
|--------|-------------|
| Magic passive memory | Active management |
| Start fresh every chat | `/start` loads your context |
| Generic outputs | Business-specific |
| Rent infrastructure | Own it (portable files) |

---

## The Curation Principle

Your repo is not a dumping ground. It's a precision instrument -- every file filtered to maximize the potential you have good outcomes with LLMs. Research gets synthesized. Decisions get distilled. Only the sharpest context makes it into reference. The better your reference files, the better every output downstream. Quantity of context hurts. Quality of context compounds.

---

## The Two Modes

| Mode | What Happens |
|------|--------------|
| **Enriching the core** | Research what interests you -> extract -> codify into reference |
| **Creating for the world** | Generate content, ads, scripts -- all informed by reference |

**The test:** If the think cycle feels like pushing, you have the wrong offer. If it feels like pull, you're in the right place.

---

## The Test (From soul.md)

Three questions to determine if you're in the right business:

1. What do you research when no one's watching?
2. What intersections excite you when you find them?
3. What decisions feel like discovery vs obligation?

If your offer doesn't connect to these -> you're pushing. You'll burn out or dissociate.

If your offer DOES connect -> the think cycle becomes self-sustaining. Pull, not push.

---

## The Name Itself

**"Main Branch" is a git metaphor.**

Your reference files are the *main branch* from which all content branches. Research and decisions are feature branches that eventually merge back into reference. The main branch is the source of truth.

But it's also about *staying on your main branch* -- not getting lost in execution, not dissociating into "content creator" mode, not outsourcing your thinking.

---

## Reference Files as Reconnection

When you're drifting into pure execution, re-read `soul.md`.

Testimonials aren't just social proof -- they're reconnection fuel that makes you *feel* the impact.

Your parts (The Builder and The Soul) need both -- reference keeps them in dialogue.

---

## The Path

The more you lean on big tech, the more you realize what you're trading. As AI scales, your data on their servers = their advantage.

| Phase | What | You Learn |
|-------|------|-----------|
| **Terminal** | Claude Code + skills | How to think with AI |
| **Personal Cloud** | Railway + Postiz | How to run infrastructure |
| **Local** | Your own box | How to depend on no one |

Not everyone goes all the way. The path exists for those who want it.
